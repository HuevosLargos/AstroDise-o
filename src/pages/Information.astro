        Hi there, I'm Alex. I build my own products, along side working with
        some amazing companies to help them build theirs.<br /><br />Most
        recently, I was working with MoonPay to help build the future of
        payments. Before that, I was working with Monzo - the fastest growing
        bank in the UK. Originally joining as a product designer, I transitioned
        into a web engineer role where I worked with a variety of teams to help
        rethink modern day banking for their millions of customers. <br /><br
        />I also worked with Kalo (which eventually became Polywork) where I was
        the first UI Engineering hire. My responsibilities included building out
        the design system as well as ensuring a high bar of design quality
        across the product.<br /><br /> I've always bounced somewhere between design
        and engineering, however the common thread has always been my love for building
        things that people love to use. If you're interested in working together,
        feel free to reach out to me here: <br /><br />
